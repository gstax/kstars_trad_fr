"In order to focus an image, Ekos needs to establish a numerical method for "
"gauging how <emphasis>good</emphasis> your focus is. It's easy when you look "
"at an image and can see it as <emphasis>unfocused</emphasis>, as the human "
"is very good at detecting that, but <emphasis>how</emphasis> can Ekos "
"possibly know that?"

"There are multiple methods. One is to calculate the Full Width at Half "
"Maximum (FHWM) of a star profile within an image, and then adjust the focus "
"until an optimal (narrower) FWHM is reached. The problem with FWHM is that "
"it assumes the initial focus position to be close to the critical focus. "
"Additionally, FWHM does not perform very well under low-intensity fluxes. An "
"Alternative method is Half-Flux-Radius (HFR), which is a measure of the "
"width in pixels counting from the center of the stars until the accumulated "
"intensity is half of the total flux of the star. HFR proved to be much more "
"stable in conditions where you might have unfavorable sky conditions, when "
"the brightness profile of the stars is low, and when the starting position "
"of the focus is far from the optimal focus."

"After Ekos processes an image, it selects the brightest star and starts "
"measuring its HFR. It can automatically select the star, or you can select "
"the star manually. It is usually recommended to select stars that are not "
"too bright as they might get saturated during the focusing process. A "
"magnitude 3 or 4 star is often sufficient."

"Ekos then begins the focusing process by commanding the focuser to focus "
"inwards or outwards, and re-measures the HFR. This establishes a V-shaped "
"curve in which the sweet spot of optimal focus is at the center of the V-"
"curve, and the slope of which depends on the properties of the telescope and "
"camera in use. In Ekos, a full V-curve is never constructed as the focusing "
"process works iteratively, so under most circumstances, a half V-curve shape "
"as illustrated in the Focus Module image is measured."

"Because the HFR varies linearly with focus distance, it is possible to "
"calculate the optimal focus point. In practice, Ekos operates iteratively by "
"moving in discrete steps, decided initially by the user-configurable step "
"size and later by the slope of the V-curve, to get closer to the optimal "
"focus position where it then changes gears and performs smaller, finer moves "
"to reach the optimal focus. In the default <guilabel>Iterative</guilabel> "
"algorithm, the focus process stops when the measured HFR is within the "
"configurable tolerance of the minimum recorded HFR in the process. In other "
"words, whenever the process starts searching for a solution within a "
"narrowly limited range, it checks if the current HFR is within % difference "
"compared to the minimum HFR recorded, and if this condition is met then the "
"autofocus process is considered successful. The default value is set to 1% "
"and is sufficient for most situations. The <guilabel>Step</guilabel> options "
"specify the number of <emphasis>initial</emphasis> ticks the focuser has to "
"move. If the image is severely out of focus, we set the step size high (&ie; "
"&gt; 250). On the other hand, if the focus is close to optimal focus, we set "
"the step size to a more reasonable range (&lt; 50). It takes trial and error "
"to find the best starting tick, but Ekos only uses that for the first focus "
"motion, as all subsequent motions depend on the V-Curve slope calculations."

"When using the <guilabel>Polynomial</guilabel> algorithm, the process starts "
"in the <guilabel>Iterative</guilabel> mode, but once we cross to the other "
"side of the V-curve (&ie; once HFR values start increasing again after "
"decreasing for a while), the Ekos performs polynomial fitting to find a "
"solution that predicts the minimum possible HFR position. If a valid "
"solution is found, the autofocus process is considered successful."
