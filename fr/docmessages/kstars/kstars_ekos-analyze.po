"The Analyze Module records and displays what happened in an imaging session. "
"That is, it does not control any if your imaging, but rather reviews what "
"occurred. Sessions are stored in an <filename class=\"directory\">analyze</"
"filename> folder, a sister folder to the main logging folder. The <literal "
"role=\"extension\">.analyze</literal> files written there can be loaded into "
"the <guilabel>Analyze</guilabel> tab to be viewed. <guilabel>Analyze</"
"guilabel> also can display data from the current imaging session."

"There are two main graphs, <guilabel>Timeline</guilabel> and "
"<guilabel>Stats</guilabel>. They are coordinated&mdash;they always display "
"the same time interval from the Ekos session, though the x-axis of the "
"<guilabel>Timeline</guilabel> shows seconds elapsed from the start of the "
"log, and <guilabel>Stats</guilabel> shows clock time. The x-axis can be "
"zoomed in and out with the <guibutton>+/-</guibutton> button, mouse "
"<mousebutton>wheel</mousebutton>, as well as with standard keyboard "
"shortcuts (&eg; zoom-in == <keycombo>&Ctrl;<keycap>+</keycap></keycombo>) "
"The x-axis can be panned with the scroll bar as well as with the left and "
"right arrow keys. You can view your current imaging session, or review old "
"sessions by loading <literal role=\"extension\">.analyze</literal> files "
"using the <guilabel>Input</guilabel> dropdown. Checking <guilabel>Full "
"Width</guilabel> displays all the data, and <guilabel>Latest</guilabel> "
"displays the most recent data (you can control the width by zooming)."

"A variety of statistics can be displayed on the <guilabel>Stats</guilabel> "
"graph. There are too many for all to be shown in a readable way, so select "
"among them with the checkboxes. A reasonable way to start might be to use "
"<guilabel>rms</guilabel>, <guilabel>snr</guilabel> (using the internal "
"guider with SEP Multistar), and <guilabel>hfr</guilabel> (if you have auto-"
"compute HFR in the FITS options). Experiment with others. The axis shown "
"(0-5) is appropriate only for ra/dec error, drift, rms, pulses, and hfr. "
"These may be y-axis scaled (awkwardly) using the mouse <mousebutton>wheel</"
"mousebutton>, but the other graphs cannot be scaled. To reset y-axis "
"zooming, right-click on the Stats plot. Clicking on the graph fills in the "
"values of the displayed statistics. This graph is zoomed and panned "
"horizontally in coordination with the timeline."
